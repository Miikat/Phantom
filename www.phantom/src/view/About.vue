        <h1>Phantom</h1>
        <p>Phantom was conceived out of a need: A need for easy to use tools aimed at the lay person.</p>
        <p>The SAFE network is an amazing bundle of technologies but as a project in active development it can be brittle and hard to understand without a degree in Computer Science. For the network to grow and flourish, normal people need to be able to access the network. It should be as easy as sending an SMS, it should be as easy as opening an app. It should be as easy as breathing.</p>
        <p>That's the Phantom motto: It should be as easy as breathing.</p>
        <h2>Contributing code</h2>
        <p>Phantom is built in VueJS, with almost zero dependencies. Users can contribute code via Github - clearnet links to our repositories can be found in the footer of this page. We welcome issues reporting bugs, requesting features and pull requests implementing any existing issues.</p>
        <h2>Contributing money</h2>
        <p>Phantom is entirely to use (except for the basic cost of using the SAFE network). We don't solicit or accept any donations for the functionality provided herein.</p>
