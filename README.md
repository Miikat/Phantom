# Phantom

A publishing tool enabling users of the SAFE Network to easily manage websites. Phantom is designed to live entirely within the SAFE network, allowing users to create and manage websites and blogs without ever being exposed to the clearnet.

This project is MIT licensed, feel free to deploy your own version of Phantom to a SAFE network public name (The SAFE version of DNS) you own if you want a customised Phantom platform.
